John Green's recent video on
[Vlogbrothers](https://www.youtube.com/vlogbrothers) got me thinking a lot about
why I take photos and the impact that social media has had on photography.

I first got into photography when I was young. I was obsessed with taking photos of
everything and anything just to capture that experience. Most of the photos I took were
of random trees and stuff, but, some photos turned out decent. It did not matter 
the quality of the photos were, the important thing was that I was preserving, capturing, and
digitizing something so real and breathtaking like nature.
