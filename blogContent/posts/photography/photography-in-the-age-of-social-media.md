John Green's recent video on
[Vlogbrothers](https://www.youtube.com/vlogbrothers) got me thinking a lot about
why I take photos and the impact that social media has had on photography.

I first got into photography when I was young. I was obsessed with taking photos
of anything from my toys to the breathtaking scenery of state parks. Most of the photos I took were
of random trees and stuff, only a few photos turned out decent. However, back then it did not matter 
the quality of the photos, the important thing was that I was preserving, capturing, and
digitizing something so real and breathtaking. Back then photography was a tool
for archiving the past: a way of stamping reality. John Green in his videos said
"I sometimes fell like something isn't really real unless I've documented it,
 as if my memories and even my life will just split past like the clouds through last night sky".  

I lost interest in photography shortly after I started middle school. The only photography that I
did was for social media. Apps like Snapchat and Instagram demand a constant stream
of photos to bombard your friends with. This is how I slowly learned that 
photography is merely a "cropping of reality". I often found myself searching for that
right moment to take a photo and turn it into a Snapchat story. I don't see this 
as a huge issue, it is good to share your experiences; however, we 
have to recognize that we present ourselves at our best
on social media.
I take issue with people who do anniversary posts where they 
post senior ball or vacation pictures annually with a short caption like "missing the beach".
Although we subconsciously know that people's lives are not always like their Instagram photos;
it is hard for younger impressionable people to make this distinction when scrolling through
a massive feed of photos portraying people at their best. That is why to this day 
I prefer using Snapchat over Instagram. Snapchat is more personal and conversational capturing day to 
day activities where Instragram is a more polished refined version of someone's desired
appearance.

While on an internship  I found myself once again getting back into photography.
This time around I find myself doing this more as an artistic hobby rather
than an attempt to document my experiences or find something to post on social media.
