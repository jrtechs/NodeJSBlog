Following the tradition I started last [year](https://jrtechs.net/other/2018-in-review), I'm making a quick "year in review" blog post.
At this point year in review posts are clich√©, however, I want to continue the tradition because reflection helps me move forward with a focused vision on what is important. 
I'm going to chunk this into semesters because that is how my college brain thinks right now.
