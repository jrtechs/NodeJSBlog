Following the tradition I started last
[year](https://jrtechs.net/other/2018-in-review), I'm making a quick
"year in review" blog post. At this point year in review posts are
clich√©, however, I want to continue the tradition because reflection
helps me move forward with a focused vision on what is important.  I'm
going to chunk this into semesters because that is how my college
brain thinks right now.  

# Spring Semester

## RIT Datafest

Data fest is a hackathon for undergraduate students to tackle a
problem using a complex dataset. I helped my team develope a neural
network that predicts fatigue and performance for women's rugby
players.
