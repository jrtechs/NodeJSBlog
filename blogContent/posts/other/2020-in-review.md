2020; this year will likely live in infamy due to covid. 
Reflecting on this year compared to 2019 is very solemn.
Not necessarily because I didn't accomplish anything; I completed more this year than in 2019. 
But, 2020 lacks so much travel and in-person events that frequently serve as the milestones for my year.

In my 2019 post, I reflect on all the trips that I took, the hackathons I attended, and the places I gave presentations. 
However, this year I feel like I can sum up everything I did in a single sentence. 
I graduated from RIT after taking two consecutive semesters of 18 credit hours, I presented my first published paper at a virtual conference, and I started a full-time job as a software engineer.

Although concise and to the point, this single sentence obviously can't sum up my entire year since it glosses over all the work I've done.
I must summarize 2020 by reflecting on what I've learned: both at school, at work, and in my free time.
This year, I have learned so much about artificial intelligence and data mining; it feels liberating.
Nevertheless, it is impracticable to share those feats since they are not singular events but innumerable hours of work.

However, in this post, I can share some of the personal projects, blog posts, and photos that I cherish the most this year.
