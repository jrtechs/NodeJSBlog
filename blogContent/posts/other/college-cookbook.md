I occasionally cooked during High School, however, college was my first real experience cooking on 
a daily basis. Since I have lived to tell the tail, I want to share some of the recipes that
I created/found/modified which got me through my first two years of college.

# Level 1 Cooking in the Dorms

Being stuck in a dorm room you are limited to only being able to use the microwave.
Desperate times calls for desperate solutions.

## Ramen Pizza

This recipe surprised me as to how it turned out.
You start making this by microwaving the ramen noodles for about a third of the instructed time in a normal bowl.
When you place the noodles in the bowl make sure to not break them apart. 
Quickly take the romen noodles out of the bowl, dry, and place on a plate to prevent overcooking.
Next you slather the ramen noodles with your desired pizza toppings and place in the microwave for around 2 minutes. 

### Ingredients

- Ramen noodle packet
- Pasta or pizza sauce
- Cheese - preferable shredded mozzarella
- Peperoni or any pizza topping you can get

## Omelet In a Mug

Life hack: you can cook scrambled eggs in a coffee mug in the microwave. 
The resulting eggs are abnormally fluffy and taste a little strange, but, it makes for a quick dinner.
It just so happens that you can also cook hot dogs in the microwave.

One summer on a college campus I stumbled upon this recipe and clung to it since it was fast, cheep, and most of the dinning places on campus were closed by the time I got out of work. 
To make this you crack and mix two eggs in a coffee cup. 
You then microwave the coffee mug, mixing the eggs every 30 seconds.
Half way through cooking the eggs, you add a diced hotdog and some shredded cheese.
Once your eggs have all cooked, you can add a healthy dosage of salsa.
Voila, you have an omelet which can compete with whatever they are serving at the dinning hall.

## Ingredients
- 1-2 Eggs
- 1 Hotdog
- Cheese
- Salsa
