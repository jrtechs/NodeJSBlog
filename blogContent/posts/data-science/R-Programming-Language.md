R is a programming language designed for statistical analysis and graphics.
Since R has been around since 1992, it has developed a large community and has over [13 thousand packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) publicly available.
What is really cool about R is that it is an open source [GNU](http://www.gnu.org/) project.
