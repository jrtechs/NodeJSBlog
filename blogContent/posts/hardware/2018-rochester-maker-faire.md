# Introduction
A few weeks ago I presented my [musical floppy drives](https://jrtechs.net/projects/musical-floppy-drive-build-log)
at the [Rochester Maker Faire](https://rochester.makerfaire.com/) with [RITlug](https://ritlug.com/). 
Wow, that sentence had a total of three links-- you should check them out:) This post is a 
quick recap of the event and a project update for my Musical floppy drive project. For those of you who 
don't know, Maker Faires are community gatherings where people "celebrate arts, crafts, engineering, science projects and the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) mindset".

# Project Background

Musical floppy drives are floppy drives wired to an Arduino to play music. I initially started with two floppy drives;
however, that grew to 8 drives very fast.

I currently have 10 floppy drives stacked together in a tower like structure so that it is easier to take to places
like the Maker Faire and Imagine RIT.

# Future Project Upgrades

Although the 10 floppy drives are quite loud in a single room, people typically found it difficult to hear at the
Maker Faire. This was largely due to the noisiness of the hundreds of people at the convention center. To fix this
in the future I want to bring a small amplifier for the floppy drives. 

The second improvement which I plan on making is creating some form of web application where people can 
request music for the floppy drives to play.

# Cool Projects at the Maker Faire

Although there were a ton of really cool projects at the Maker Faire, I did not have the time to spend a lot of
time exploring the faire and taking pictures of everything. However, I want to share two really cool projects
that I saw at the Maker Faire. 

## HatChan

This is a project that one person is calling HatChan. This is a hat equipped with a ton of LED lights, and 
a fully functioning wireless access point. When you connect to his access point, the captcha portal takes you
to a 4chan esk site where you can upload pictures -- mostly memes.

## 8-bit Computer

This one person brought a home made 8-bit computer to the Maker Faire. What I find the most impressive
about this project was that the person who made it is only a sophomore in high school.
