# Easy Parts

We believe that the easy part of this project would be to run the git analytic tools and explore the projects communication methods.

# Hard Parts

The hardest part of this project would probably ironically be coordinating
schedules so that we can work on this together.

# Milestones

To make sure that we hit all the deadlines, we are breaking this down into two sprints.

## Sprint 1

We are placing the timeline for this sprint to be march 18th. During
this sprint we want to do the following:

- run git analytics
- explore the project to find all their mailing lists, chat channels , etc

## Sprint 2

The second sprint will be due at the same time the final submission for this project is due-- march 25th.

This sprint will comprise of:

- final blog post with a full report
- making a presentation
