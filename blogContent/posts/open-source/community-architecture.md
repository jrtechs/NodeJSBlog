This is my submission for RIT's [HFOSS](https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss) Community
architecture project. Due to the COVID situation, several changes have been
made since I drafted the [project proposal](https://jrtechs.net/open-source/community-architecture-proposal).
First, this is no-longer a group project.
Second, this project is now more focused on comparing the project architectures of
two communities rather than running analytics like git by a bus.

Exploring what works and what does not work for different projects can give us
valuable insight in trying to create new communities.
This is what is truly beautiful about open source software in it's openness giving 
us the ability to learn from it. 

# Project Introduction

This report covers two open-source projects: on-my-zsh and RITlug's website.

## Oh-my-zsh

On-my-zsh is an open-source, community-driven framework for managing ZSH configurations.
It includes many functions, helpers, plugins, and themes.

Oh-my-zsh was written almost entirely in shell script which makes sense because it
is a command line utility. The primary audience of this project is ZSH enthusiasts.

## ritlug.com

The RIT Linux Users group (RITlug)  main website is an open source project.
RITlug is a student-led organization at RIT that aims to engage students in Linux and
open source.
The website is written using Jekyll which is a ruby project for static website generation.
The website itself is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
Jekyll is nice because it enables you to do templating and write content for the
website in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
This is also the project that I chose to do my HFOSS [bug fix](https://jrtechs.net/open-source/ritlug-bugfix) with.

# Differences

This section explores the differences between the two projects.
It is important to note that there is not a once size fits all for open-source projects.
Just because one project has more/less of something does not necessarily mean that
one is better than the other.
The beauty of open-source is the ability for a project to take many shapes/sizes/forms.

## Scope

// contributors

// screen grabs from GH

## Maturity

//how old

## Governance

//who has access to it
// license 

# Takeaways

// no one size fits all
