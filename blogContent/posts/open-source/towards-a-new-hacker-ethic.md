Last week I looked at *Programming is Forgetting: Toward a New Hacker Ethic* by 
Allison Parrish for the second time. This was an amazing talk given by Allison Parrish
at the Open Hardware Summit in 2016. The first time I was introduced to this talk a year ago
my friend was trying to introduce me to the nuanced differences between
"new" and "old" FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) cultures. Every time that I
looked at this piece I get excited because it made me ponder what our community
*should* be, and what it *could* be. I am very reminiscent about
all the 80's hacker lingo and literature like the ["Hackers Manifesto"](http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html) that 
inspired me when I was in middle school.

In Parrish's talk she examined the points that Levy make in his book 
*Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution*. This talk picked out how aspects
of Levy's hacker ethos are problematic and how we can work to change this Hacker 
Ethic to be more supporting of communities.

However, before we dive into the breakdown of Levy's and Parrish's arguments,
it is important to have a common understanding of these things:

- what hacker means
- the nature of knowledge and knowing
- our assumptions about society
