# Question 13

We've discussed "the four R's" as a shorthand for the freedoms attached to software for it to be considered "free" or "open source". List or describe each. (eg, if you can remember the "r" word you can just give that. If you cannot remember the term, but can describe the freedom involved, that also counts). Various "r" words are roughly synonymous for some of the freedoms, but we're counting freedoms here, not synonyms so if you give two (or more) terms for the same freedom, it only counts once. For the purposes of this quiz, "remix" does not count as describing any of them. (1pt each)


- Run - ability to freely run the program/software
- Read - ability to view the source code
- Redistribute - ability to distribute the source-code after modifications
- Revise - ability to legally make changes to the software
