                        I am currently a third year Computer Science student at Rochester Institute of Technology.
                        I am a very outgoing person who loves collaborating and working with others.
                        Check out my <a href="https://github.com/jrtechs">GitHub</a>, blog posts, and project websites to see what I have been working on.

                        I am a self proclaimed geek; I have been programming since I salvaged parts to build a computer when I was in 6th grade.
                        Computers are my lifeblood. When I am not programming - or reading - I enjoy excising and riding my bike.

                        JrTechs is a simple personal blog where I write articles on topics that I find interesting.
                        This blog covers everything from project write-ups to tutorials on complex machine learning algorithms.

                        This site was initially started as a simple HTML site back in 2014 when I was first learning about web development.
                        This website has gone through <b>a lot</b> of changes since it was initially created in 2014.
                        Currently the site is a custom <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> application which uses <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> to render <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">Latex</a>/Markdown files as HTML documents.
