                        I am a self-proclaimed geek; I have been programming since I salvaged parts to build a computer when I was in 6th grade. Computers are my lifeblood; when I am not building software, I enjoy photography, running, reading, and cooking.

                        I am a fifth-year Computer Science student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/jrtechs">GitHub</a>, blog posts, and project websites to see what software and I've been cooking up. My current interests are in graph data, web scraping, machine learning, computer vision, and open-source software.

                        This site initially started as a static HTML site in 2014 when I was first learning the ropes of web development. Since then, this site has undergone massive changes as I expanded my web development skills. 
                        Currently the site is a custom <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> application which uses <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> to render <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">Latex</a> and Markdown files as HTML documents. This site has its very own admin portal to manage posts and has even expanded to include: customizable downloads, photography galleries, nested static websites, and static content for miscellaneous events.
